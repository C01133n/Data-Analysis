Data Quality:
Duplicate Data:
-	occurs when data representing the same transaction is accidentally duplicated within a system.
Redundant Data:
-	redundant data happens when the same data elements exist in multiple places within a system. 
-	data redundancy is a function of integrating multiple systems.
Missing Values:
-	Missing values occur when you expect an attribute to contain data but nothing is there.
-	Missing values are also known as null values. A null value is the absence of a value.
-	A null is not a space, blank, or other character.
-	Note :  Null values poses an error when working with R and Python programing try using SQL. Equivalents functions in these languages do not Handle Null values.
Invalid Data
-	Invalid data are values outside the valid range for a given attribute. 
-	An invalid value violates a business rule instead of having an incorrect data type.
