Data Analysis and Statistics:

Fundamentals of Statistics
Symbol	Meaning
 	A variable
 	Absolute value of a variable
The absolute value of a number is always positive, so  .
 	Summation For example,   denotes adding all observations of a variable together.
N	Population size
 	Population mean
 	Population variance
 	Population standard deviation
 	Sample size
 	Sample mean
 	Sample median
 	Sample variance
 	Sample standard deviation
 	Confidence level value
 	Standardized score
 	Significance level
 	Critical value for a confidence interval level
 	Pearson correlation coefficient


Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that summarizes and describes data.
-	descriptive statistics measures to help you understand the characteristics of your dataset.
Measures of frequency:
-	helps you understand how often something happens
-	When encountering a dataset for the first time, you want to determine how much data you are working with to help guide your analysis
Example: 	suppose you are working with human performance data. One of the first things to understand is the size of the dataset. One way to accomplish this quickly is to count the number of observations.

1.	Count

2.	Percentage 

- The percentage is a frequency measure that identifies the proportion of a given value for a variable with respect to the total number of rows in the dataset. 
- To calculate a percentage, you need the total number of observations and the total number of observations for a specific value of a variable.
3.	Frequency
-	Frequency describes how often a specific value for a variable occurs in a dataset.
