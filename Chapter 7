Exploring Visualization Types
1.	Charts
•	Line chart – Relationship between time and variable
•	Pie Chart - presents categorical, or discrete, data as individual slices of the pie. When using a pie chart, ensure that you label each pie slice appropriately
•	Bar chart - Similar to a pie chart
•	Stacked chart - starts with a bar chart and extends it by incorporating proportional segments on each bar for categorical data.
•	Scatter chart - uses a dot for each observation in a data set to show the relationship between two numeric variables.
•	Bubble chart - scatterplot where the size of each dot is dependent on a third numeric variable
