Databases and Data Acquisition :

Databases categories:
-	Relational
-	Nonrelational
Relational Model:
•	1969 – Edgar F. Codd from IBM developed relational Model for Database management.
•	Builds concept of Tabular data.
•	Entity contains data for a single subject.
Cardinality refers to the relationship between two entities, showing how many instances of one entity relate to instances in another entity.
ERD – 
The first component of the terminator indicates whether the relationship between two entities is optional or required
The second component indicates whether an entity instance in the first table is associated with a single entity instance in the related table or if an association can exist with multiple entity instances.
 

A unary relationship is when an entity has a connection with itself.
A binary relationship connects two entities
A ternary relationship connects three entities.
N:B: Binary relationships are the most common and easy to explore, whereas unary and ternary are comparatively complex and rare.
A database administrator (DBA) is a highly trained person who understands how database software interacts with computer hardware.
-	looks after how the database uses the underlying storage, memory, and processor resources assigned to the database
-	looks for processes that are slowing the entire database down.
Referential Integrity
Relational Database Providers:
•	oracle – released in 1979
•	Microsoft SQL server
•	open source community created offerings including MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
•	Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed Aurora
Nonrelational Databases:
•	Data validation happens in code, as opposed to being done in the database.
•	Key-value - A key-value database is one of the simplest ways of storing data. Data is stored as a collection of keys and their corresponding values. A key must be globally unique across the entire database.

•	Document - A document database is similar to a key-value database, with additional restrictions.
•	Column-family = Column-family databases use an index to identify data in groups of related columns.
•	Graph - Graph databases specialize in exploring relationships between pieces of data
Database Use Cases:
Databases tend to support two major categories of data processing: 
-	Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) - include booking a flight reservation, ordering something online, or executing a stock trade.
-	 and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
Normalization is a process for structuring a database in a way that minimizes duplication of data.
-	One of the principles is that a given piece of data is stored once and only once. As a result, a normalized database is ideal for processing transactions.
-	First normal form (1NF) is when every row in a table is unique and every column contains a unique value.
-	2NF applies an additional rule stating that all nonprimary key values must depend on the entire primary key.
-	Third normal form (3NF) builds upon 2NF by adding a rule stating all columns must depend on only the primary key
Online Analytical Processing
-	OLAP systems focus on the ability of organizations to analyze data.
Schema concept:
-	The design of a database schema depends on the purpose it serves.
-	 Transactional systems require highly normalized databases, whereas a denormalized design is more appropriate for analytical systems.
-	Star schemas are denormalized to improve read performance over large datasets.
-	A snowflake schema is less denormalized than the star schema.
•	One advantage of this approach is that it is easy to retrieve the current price while maintaining access to historical information.
A data warehouse is a database that aggregates data from many transactional systems for analytical purposes.
-	A data warehouse facilitates analytics across the entire company.
Transactional data may come from systems that :
-	power the human resources, 
-	sales, 
-	marketing, 
-	and product divisions.
Data Mart–
-	 a subnet of data warehouse. 
-	Data warehouses serve the entire organization, whereas data marts focus on the needs of a particular department within the organization.
Data Lake - stores raw data in its native format instead of conforming to a relational database structure.
Dimensionality  - refers to the number of attributes a table has.
-	he greater the number of attributes, the higher the dimensionality.
-	One dimension you will frequently encounter is time. It is necessary to answer questions about when something happened or when something was true.
Handling Dimensionality:
-	Another approach is to use an indicator flag for the current price.
-	The indicator flag method keeps all pricing data in a single place
-	It also simplifies the query structure to get the current price.
