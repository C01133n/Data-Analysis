Databases and Data Acquisition :

Databases categories:
-	Relational
-	Nonrelational
Relational Model:
•	1969 – Edgar F. Codd from IBM developed relational Model for Database management.
•	Builds concept of Tabular data.
•	Entity contains data for a single subject.
Cardinality refers to the relationship between two entities, showing how many instances of one entity relate to instances in another entity.
ERD – 
The first component of the terminator indicates whether the relationship between two entities is optional or required
The second component indicates whether an entity instance in the first table is associated with a single entity instance in the related table or if an association can exist with multiple entity instances.
 

A unary relationship is when an entity has a connection with itself.
A binary relationship connects two entities
A ternary relationship connects three entities.
N:B: Binary relationships are the most common and easy to explore, whereas unary and ternary are comparatively complex and rare.
A database administrator (DBA) is a highly trained person who understands how database software interacts with computer hardware.
-	looks after how the database uses the underlying storage, memory, and processor resources assigned to the database
-	looks for processes that are slowing the entire database down.
Referential Integrity
Relational Database Providers:
•	oracle – released in 1979
•	Microsoft sql server
•	open source community created offerings including MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
•	Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed Aurora
Nonrelational Databases:
•	Data validation happens in code, as opposed to being done in the database.
•	Key-value - A key-value database is one of the simplest ways of storing data. Data is stored as a collection of keys and their corresponding values. A key must be globally unique across the entire database.

•	Document - A document database is similar to a key-value database, with additional restrictions.
•	Column-family = Column-family databases use an index to identify data in groups of related columns.
•	Graph - Graph databases specialize in exploring relationships between pieces of data
